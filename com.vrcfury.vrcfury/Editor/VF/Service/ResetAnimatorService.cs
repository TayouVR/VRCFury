     * Disabling the Animator during the build has a LOT of benefits:
     * 1. If you clip.SampleAnimation on the avatar while it has a humanoid Avatar set on its Animator, it'll
     *    bake into motorcycle pose.
     * 2. If you change the avatar or controller on the Animator, the Animator will reset all transforms of all
     *    children objects back to the way they were at the start of the frame.
     * 3. If GestureManager (or someone else) started animating our avatar before the build, we need to undo their changes
     *    to get the avatar back into the default position (WriteDefaultValues)
     * 4. If GestureManager (or someone else) changes the controller on the Animator after we build during this same frame,
     *    it would reset all the child transforms back to how they were before we built. To "lock them in," we need to
     *    reset the animator.
